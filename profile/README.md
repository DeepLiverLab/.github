Welcome to the GitHub page for the Deep Liver Lab!

We are a group of computer scientists and medical students working on AI systems for liver analysis. We are based in the Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf and report to Prof. Tom Lüdde.

Here, we will publish all code relevant to research we produce.
