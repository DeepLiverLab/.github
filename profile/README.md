Welcome to the GitHub page for the Deep Liver Lab!

We are a group of computer scientists and medical students working on AI systems for liver analysis. We are based in the Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf and report to Prof. Tom Lüdde.

Here, we will publish all code relevant to research we produce.


The Deep Liver Project

Background: Liver diseases are widespread and can have life-threatening consequences, requiring new approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

Aim:  Develop and validate computer-based methods for diagnosis and prediction of unfavourable courses in liver diseases.

Methods: Evaluation of histological images from liver biopsies and clinical data by means of deep learning with artificial neural networks.

Application: Develop and test a prototype of an online platform for decentralised provision of deep learning methods.

Longterm goal: Offer a tool that will improve individual risk prediction and accelerate the diagnosis of rare diseases.
